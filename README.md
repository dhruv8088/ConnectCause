## Theme- Partnerships for the Goals

## Problem Statement
Addressing the issue of insufficient donors for contributing towards the betterment of society

## Proposed Solution
To address the above mentioned problem statement, we need to develop a proper infrastructure for bringing about ease of donation. Our idea is to create a social media platform to bridge the gap between the willing donors and NGOs.

## Features

<b>User Feed :</b> The user feed of any individual will contain posts from NGOs of his/ her city to ensure more relevant posts reach the user.<br><br>
<b>Discover Page:</b> Via the discover page the user can filter posts based on his needs and wants. This filtering is done via tags related to each post.<br><br>
<b>End to End User Communication:</b> Features of chatting and calling directly via the app facilitate smooth communication between users and NGOs who want to connect.<br><br>
<b>Transparency :</b> Every post comes in with a feature to mark the post as completed. So NGOs can mark their events as completed after its completion. But before any post is marked as completed the NGO has to provide the data of where the donations of the donors has been used. This data is directly mailed to donor’s email address via the app. This process ensures transparency is maintained in the working if the NGO.<br><br>
<b>NGO Reliability :</b> Whenever any NGO signs up in the app, it has to provide an unique identification number. This unique identification no. is stored in government records to ensure. The NGO’s profile in the app caries this unique identification number along with the link to ‘NGO Darpan’ website, an official government portal to check the verification of any NGO using the unique identification number.<br><br>
